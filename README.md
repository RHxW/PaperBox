## What is PaperBox?
PaperBox is a useful tool to help managing your research work, especially paper reading.

You can download(or not) the papers you're interested in on PaperBox by putting the url of the paper into it, and it will download(or not) and organize the papers for you, you can also read the papers online. Once you start reading a newly downloaded paper, the software will create a markdown file as your **review doc** on this paper so you can write your opinions and ideas down. And more interestingly, you can write down some short comments on these papers and share the comment along with the paper to your friends on social media. You can also see others' comments on papers, as well as they can see yours(once you set your comments to be public).

As a research doc management software, the most important function was to be managing the research docs. 

You can share the paper or just one little part which you're interested in to your partners, co-works or friends on PaperBox, and they will see the exact you just shared along with you comment, text and images.
